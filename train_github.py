name = input('please insert your name: ')
team = input('what is your favorite soccor team? ')
print ('hello'  '! + your favorite team is + team)





num1 = input ('please insert the first number: ')
num2 = input ('please insert the second number: ')
operation = input ('please insert your desire operation among: ')
if operation == '+':
   results = num1 + num2
if operation == '-': 
    result = num1 - num2
if operation == '*':
    result = num1 * num2
if operation == '/':
    result = num1 / num2
    
print(result)            

what I learned from the youtube about if clause is scripts same as above but I couldnt run these orders and I think I made some mistakes in some perts. please correct them and send them back to me.
